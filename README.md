# Batman React App

## Description

This is a memory game React application that demonstrates how to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. The theme is Batman the animated series.

## How to play

The application renders different Batman villains to the screen. Each villain (image) listens for click events. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when defeating a villain (clicking an image) for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if they defeat the same villain (click the same image) more than once. 

Every time a villain is defeated (an image is clicked), the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.

## Development

This application was built utilizing create-react-app
